# processing-physics-water-surface
 An experimental project simulating a 2D water surface line, then visualizing it in a cool way! The simulation applies Hooke's law to a number of springs (here they can be thought of as the vertical lines), and the net force on each spring is affected by adjacent spring positions. The spring also affects its adjacent springs. This is loosely based off a [blog post I read][key] on generating dynamic 2D water effects!
