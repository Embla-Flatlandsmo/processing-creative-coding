# modular-grid
A grid that renders svg tiles based on its neighbors. Drag the mouse to draw some tiles and see how the rendered tiles change!
My implementation of [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) P.2.3.6 with some tweaks of my own. Tiles made by [Mats N. Olsen](https://www.instagram.com/claystation2/).

## Controls

* **r**: reflect the currently drawn tiles (only draws new tiles, does not erase any)
* **m**: start mirroring drawing
* **c**: clear canvas
* **s**: save to svg
