# processing-van-goghify
 A project that takes in an image and turns it into a beautiful starry-night-esque piece of art! Based off [this helpful writeup I found on OpenProcessing][key]. I use perlin noise that maps to the `(x,y)` coordinates of each pixel and use that to deterimne the rotation of the generated rectangle. The color of the rectangle is sampled from the imported image's corresponding coordinate. The project also includes a cutout of two images I've made.

## Use
Press the `left mouse button` to change the image being Van-Goghified.
