# processing-jellyfish
 A project that generates a still picture of a jellyfish-like creature. I made a physics-based particle class (with vectors acceleration, velocity and position) to determine where the tentacles should go. 

 ## Use
1. Click on the canvas to reposition the head of the jellyfish upon generation.
2. Press `c` to generate a new jellyfish!

After exporting the image and doing some more illustration work around it, I created the following illustration. Here, the tentacles are from this project, but I redrew the head!
